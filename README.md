Current iteration of mischaikow.com

## Todo

- **Make this site work with AWS** This was built to replace website-2, but there are sure to be some integration problems
- **Automate Certbot** I followed [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66638368/how-to-do-auto-renewal-of-tls-certificates-with-certbot) to set up my Certbot, but haven't yet set up the cron job to check for new certs
- **Get S3 Bucket set up** My resume really should be somewhere on my website...
- **Clear out GitHub Actions errors** There are a litany of errors that are consequences of how I set things up. My GitHub Actions setup is hacky and not particularly robust, which leaves a lot to be desired.
