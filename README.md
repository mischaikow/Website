## TODO

- **Automate Certbot** I followed [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66638368/how-to-do-auto-renewal-of-tls-certificates-with-certbot) to set up my Certbot, but haven't yet set up the cron job to check for new certs.
- **Get S3 Bucket set up** My resume should really be somewhere on my website...
- **Clear out GitHub Actions Errors** There are a litany of existing errors that are the consequence of how I set things up. My GitHub Actions setup is hacky and not particularly robust, which leaves a lot to be desired.
